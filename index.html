			<h2>Q: How do I register?</h2>
			<p>Registration to claim your ticket to Vice will open by the end of September.</p>
			<h2>Q: How much do tickets cost?</h2>
			<p>This event is FREE, but we encourage you to contribute to our bar tab to allow our Service Animals to provide you with a seamless, immersive experience.</p>
			<h2>Q: What should I wear?</h2>
			<p>We encourage wearing sturdy, closed shoes. Otherwise, be your best sexy self! The only restriction is that genitalia must remain covered, but sometimes it’s best to leave a little to the imagination!</p>
			<h2>Q: Will there be cloaking facilities on site?</h2>
			<p>We will have a dedicated space for bag storage on site, however any items left unattended is done so at your own risk.</p>
			<h2>Q: Can I get a ticket at the door?</h2>
			<p>For the safety of all attendees, this is a strictly ticketed event and there will be no way to register at the door.</p>
			<h2>Q: Can I take photos?</h2>
			<p>We highly encourage attendees to stay in the moment as much as possible. If you do wish to get a picture, please ensure that other attendees are not inadvertently being captured in the background.</p>
			<h2>Q: Will I need ID?</h2>
			<p>Yes! Vice will be operating with a strict guest list and you should be prepared to show a government issued photo ID at entry.</p>
			<h2>Q: Will food be provided?</h2>
			<p>An open bar will be available for all attendees (Find one of our sexy servers to have your drink brought to you!) but food will not be provided at Vice. There are many dining options within a few minutes walk, including Italian at The Banff, pub fare at The Fifth Province and a late-night fix at Coco Kebabs.</p>
			<h2>Q: How do I get there?</h2>
			<p>Tram routes 16 (from Melbourne Central/Flinders St) and 96 (from Southern Cross) stop at Canterbury Rd outside The Play Lounge. Other tram routes 3, 5, 64 and 67 stop at St Kilda Junction, around a 12 minute walk from the Play Lounge.</p>
			<p>Street parking along Fitzroy St is limited, but there are paid parking options in Albert Park Reserve along Lakeside Drive (free after 9pm), behind the Prince of Wales Hotel off Acland St or along Jacka Boulevard.</p>
